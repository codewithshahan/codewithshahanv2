IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT RULES (Always follow these):

1. ARCHITECTURE: Separate server/client components properly; never use 'use client' with metadata exports; always serialize data between boundaries.

2. UI/UX: Follow Apple design principles with clean typography and subtle animations; ensure responsive design and proper loading states.

3. HYDRATION: Always use isMounted pattern; default to dark theme for SSR; provide loading fallbacks before hydration completes.

4. COMPONENTS: Build atomic components with clear props; implement proper TypeScript variants; follow compound patterns for complex UI.

5. PERFORMANCE: Use Next.js Image with proper sizing; implement code splitting; optimize bundle size; memoize expensive computations.

6. ERROR HANDLING: Implement strategic error boundaries; create graceful fallbacks; properly handle and log errors; design for poor network conditions.

7. CODE QUALITY: Use consistent naming (PascalCase for components); add proper TypeScript types; follow SOLID principles; use modern ES6+ patterns.

8. PREMIUM INNOVATION: Implement cutting-edge functionality that exceeds expectations; create delightful micro-interactions; develop 3D elements and spatial UI where appropriate; integrate subtle parallax effects.

9. MOTION EXCELLENCE: Design fluid transitions between states; implement spring physics for natural movement; ensure animations convey meaning and enhance usability; use gesture-driven interactions.

10. PROGRESSIVE APPROACH: First create minimal, reusable component foundations; then progressively enhance with premium features; maintain modularity while extending capabilities.

11. APPLE PRECISION: Apply pixel-perfect spacing; implement dynamic typography system; use depth and layering strategically; ensure consistent visual hierarchy and intentional affordances.

12. SENSORY DESIGN: Integrate subtle haptic feedback patterns; implement spatial audio where relevant; use color theory for psychological impact; create interfaces that feel tactile and responsive.

All code must be production-ready, optimized, and follow Apple-level design standards with obsessive attention to detail. Every interaction should feel intentional, refined, and delightful in the tradition of world-class digital product/website design in the style of a professional senior Apple UI/UX software engineer and developer with 30y of word-class professional creative experience.
